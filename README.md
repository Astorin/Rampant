There will be a slight pause the first time this is started up due to indexing all the chunks that have been generated.  

# Features

Unit Group Merging  - if multiple unit groups retreat at the same time there is a chance the groups will merge  
Unit Group Forming - any chunks with spawners in it that is covered by a pollution, player, player base, or player defense pheromone clouds will form groups based on the evolution factor  
Probing Behavior Against Defenses - unit groups will attempt to avoid chunks that are soaked in death  
Player Hunting  - unit groups will track the player based on there emitted pheromone cloud  
Pathfinding - unit groups will use potential fields to perform only single step pathfinding allowing for efficient and dynamic pathing
